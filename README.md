📝 Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Backend is a robust and scalable system designed to handle core functionalities similar to Airbnb. It supports user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and hosts.

🎯 Project Goals
- User Management: Register, authenticate, and manage user profiles
- Property Listings: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property data
- Booking System: Reserve properties and manage bookings
- Payment Processing: Handle transactions securely
- Review System: Allow users to rate and review properties
- Performance: Optimize data retrieval with indexing and caching

🛠️ Technology Stack
- Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework
   DjangoL: A high-level Python web framework used to build and manage the backend server, define models, and structure the entire application logic.
   Django REST Framework (DRF): An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs, handling serialization, authentication, and request/response processing.
   GraphQL: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.
   PostgreSQL: A powerful and reliable relational database used to store user data, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.
   Celery: A task queue used for handling asynchronous operations such as sending notifications, processing payments, and background tasks.
   Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching and managing Celery task queues to boost performance and responsiveness.
   Docker: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines
Automated pipelines that run tests and deploy code changes efficiently, improving development workflow and minimizing deployment issues.
- API Architecture: RESTful API + GraphQL support
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Asynchronous Tasks: Celery
- Caching & Sessions: Redis
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: Automated pipelines for testing & deployment
