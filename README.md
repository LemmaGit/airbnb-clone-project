📝 Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Backend is a robust and scalable system designed to handle core functionalities similar to Airbnb. It supports user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and hosts.

🎯 Project Goals
- User Management: Register, authenticate, and manage user profiles
- Property Listings: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property data
- Booking System: Reserve properties and manage bookings
- Payment Processing: Handle transactions securely
- Review System: Allow users to rate and review properties
- Performance: Optimize data retrieval with indexing and caching

🛠️ Technology Stack
- Backend Framework: Django, Django REST Framework
   DjangoL: A high-level Python web framework used to build and manage the backend server, define models, and structure the entire application logic.
   Django REST Framework (DRF): An extension of Django that simplifies building RESTful APIs, handling serialization, authentication, and request/response processing.
   GraphQL: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility in data retrieval.
   PostgreSQL: A powerful and reliable relational database used to store user data, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews.
   Celery: A task queue used for handling asynchronous operations such as sending notifications, processing payments, and background tasks.
   Redis: An in-memory data store used for caching and managing Celery task queues to boost performance and responsiveness.
   Docker: A containerization platform that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated containers, ensuring consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines
Automated pipelines that run tests and deploy code changes efficiently, improving development workflow and minimizing deployment issues.
- API Architecture: RESTful API + GraphQL support
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Asynchronous Tasks: Celery
- Caching & Sessions: Redis
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: Automated pipelines for testing & deployment

🔍 Feature Breakdown

 -👤 User Management
   Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This feature ensures proper authentication and authorization, enabling a personalized experience for each user.
 -🏠 Property Management
   Hosts can create, update, view, and delete property listings. This feature enables them to showcase their accommodations with relevant details for potential guests.
 -📅 Booking System
   Users can book available properties by selecting check-in and check-out dates. It manages availability and prevents double bookings, forming the core interaction between guests and hosts.
 -💳 Payment Processing
   Handles payment transactions for bookings, recording payment status and details. This ensures secure and reliable processing of financial activities within the platform.
 -⭐ Review System
   Enables users to leave ratings and feedback on properties they’ve stayed at. It promotes trust and helps future guests make informed decisions.
 -⚡ Performance Optimization
   Implements database indexing and caching for fast data retrieval and efficient load handling. This ensures the backend performs well under real-world usage conditions.


🔐 API Security
 -🔑 Authentication & Authorization
   Secure login and token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) will be used to verify users and control access.
   Protects user accounts and ensures only authorized users can access or modify data (e.g., hosts managing their properties).
 -🔒 Password Hashing
   User passwords will be hashed using strong algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) before storage.
   Prevents exposure of sensitive credentials in case of a data breach.
 -📈 Rate Limiting
   API endpoints will implement rate limiting to prevent abuse or brute-force attacks.
   Protects the server from overload and enhances overall platform stability.
 -💳 Payment Security
   Payments will be processed through secure, PCI-compliant gateways (e.g., Stripe).
   Ensures financial data is handled securely, building trust with users and reducing liability.
 -🛡️ Data Validation & Sanitization
   All inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.
   Ensures backend integrity and protects the application from malicious inputs.
 -🔍 Access Controls**
   Fine-grained permissions will restrict data access (e.g., users can only edit their own data).
   Prevents unauthorized actions and enforces data ownership.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)** automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. CI ensures that new code is automatically tested, while CD deploys approved changes to production quickly and reliably.

### **Why It’s Important:**

* Reduces manual errors in deployment
* Speeds up development and delivery
* Ensures consistent testing and quality assurance

### **Tools Used:**

* **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows
* **Docker**: Provides a consistent environment for building and deploying the app
* **Docker Hub/GitHub Container Registry**: For storing and pulling container images
